# yafra php slim

## Purpose
This module acts as a RESTful server based on PHP and Slimframework. It provides a simple database access (native sql drivers - no ORM - currently MySQL). PHP is supported very well on many different hosting providers and therefore provides a simple approach to implement a server providing RESTful API, mainly for mobile or fat clients.

## Starting with PHP Slimframework

 * PHP 5.x enabled web server with common modules installed
 * MySQL database with a "yafra" database model
 * update the include/Config.php as needed
 * use curl or Chrom REST Console plugin to test
